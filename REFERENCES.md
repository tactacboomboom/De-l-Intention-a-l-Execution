## planning-with-files (external dependency)

This method relies on the execution discipline defined in
"planning-with-files" by Othman Adi.

The original repository and its full documentation are available here:
https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files

In particular, the execution phase ε follows the rules described in:
https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md

This repository does not reimplement planning-with-files.
It composes with it.
