# DEFINITION OF DONE

The sprint is considered complete if and only if:

- README.md clearly points to ARCHITECTURE.md.
- ARCHITECTURE.md defines φ, κ, and ε with inputs, outputs, and rules.
- An example exists under /examples demonstrating the full chain.
- All backlog items have a corresponding completed phase in task_plan.md.
