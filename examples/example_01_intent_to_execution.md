# Example 01 — From intent to execution

## Intent (I)
"I want to publish a minimal GitHub repository documenting my method."

## Clarification (φ → C)
See:
- contrat/GOAL.md
- contrat/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md
- contrat/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md

## Compilation (κ → F)
The backlog items are compiled into phases in `task_plan.md`
with a strict 1-to-1 mapping.

## Execution (ε → E)
Execution follows planning-with-files discipline:
- findings are logged in `findings.md`
- proofs are logged in `progress.md`
- phases are marked complete once DoD criteria are met

## Proof of completion

This example corresponds to Sprint Phase 1–3 defined in task_plan.md.

All phases are marked as complete and are traceable through:
- findings.md
- progress.md
